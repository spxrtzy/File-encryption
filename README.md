## For V.1.0

# Encrypter with RSA Key

This project was made by spxrtzy 1.0

## How to Use?
1. First you need to run the 'RSAkeygenerator.py' file to create an RSA Code
2. Open the file named 'encrypter.py' and change files and directory's etc. and run
3. Now you have an encrypted file

The RSA code is in the key.key file

## How to decrypt
1. Open the 'decrypt.py' file, and change to the desired destinations and names etc.
2. Run the file and now you encrypted file is decrypted





## For V.1.2
1. Open the file named 'encrypter.py' and change files and directory's etc. and run
2. Now you have an encrypted file

The RSA code is in the key.key file

## How to decrypt
1. Open the 'decrypt.py' file, and change to the desired destinations and names etc.
2. Run the file and now you encrypted file is decrypted


#The difference between V.1.0 and V.1.2?
The difference between these to version is that the older version you have to manually create an rsa code, but the newer version does it automatically.
