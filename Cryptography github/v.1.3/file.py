This Script was made by spxrtzy
What it does is it encrypts and decrypts your files of choice.

NOTE: THE KEY TO YOUR FILES THAT WILL BE USED TO DECRYPT IT IS LOCATED IN THE "key.key" FILE BY DEAFULT
IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES DON'T HESITATE TO WRITE TO ME(twitter: @lzmogus)

Things you will need for encryption:
There is not much really you need for the encryption part, just keep in mind that the .key file will be created in the same folder as the encrypted file.

Things you will need for decryption:

1. You need to have both the .key file and the encrypted file in the same folder or else it won't work
2. Make sure that the key is correct to the file
3. Make sure that the .key file is not empty.
